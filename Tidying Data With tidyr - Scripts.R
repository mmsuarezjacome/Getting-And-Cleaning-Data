# Repeat your calls to gather() and separate(), but this time
# use the %>% operator to chain the commands together without
# storing an intermediate result.
#
# If this is your first time seeing the %>% operator, check
# out ?chain, which will bring up the relevant documentation.
# You can also look at the Examples section at the bottom
# of ?gather and ?separate.
#
# The main idea is that the result to the left of %>%
# takes the place of the first argument of the function to
# the right. Therefore, you OMIT THE FIRST ARGUMENT to each
# function.

students2 %>%
  gather(sex_class, count, -grade) %>%

SCRIPT2

# Call gather() to gather the columns class1 through
# through class5 into a new variable called class.
# The 'key' should be class, and the 'value'
# should be grade.
#
# tidyr makes it easy to reference multiple adjacent
# columns with class1:class5, just like with sequences
# of numbers.
#
# Since each student is only enrolled in two of
# the five possible classes, there are lots of missing
# values (i.e. NAs). Use the argument na.rm = TRUE
# to omit these values from the final result.
#
# Remember that when you're using the %>% operator,
# the value to the left of it gets inserted as the
# first argument to the function on the right.
#
# Consult ?gather and/or ?chain if you get stuck.

SCRIPT3

# This script builds on the previous one by appending
# a call to spread(), which will allow us to turn the
# values of the test column, midterm and final, into
# column headers (i.e. variables).
#
# You only need to specify two arguments to spread().
# Can you figure out what they are? (Hint: You don't
# have to specify the data argument since we're using
# the %>% operator.

SCRIPT4

# We want the values in the class columns to be
# 1, 2, ..., 5 and not class1, class2, ..., class5.
#
# Use the mutate() function from dplyr along with
# extract_numeric(). Hint: You can "overwrite" a column
# with mutate() by assigning a new value to the existing
# column instead of creating a new column.
#
# Check out ?mutate and/or ?extract_numeric if you need
# a refresher.

# selecting the id, name, and sex column from students4
# and storing the result in student_info.

student_info <- students4 %>%
  select(id, name, sex) %>%
  print()


SCRIPT6

# Add a call to unique() below, which will remove
# duplicate rows from student_info.
#
# Like with the call to the print() function below,
# you can omit the parentheses after the function name.
# This is a nice feature of %>% that applies when
# there are no additional arguments to specify.

# Append two more function calls to accomplish the following:

# 1. Use group_by() (from dplyr) to group the data by part and

# 2. Use mutate to add two new columns, whose values will be
# automatically computed group-by-group:

#   * total = sum(count)
