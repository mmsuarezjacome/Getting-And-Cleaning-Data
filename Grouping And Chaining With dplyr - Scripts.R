# 1. Separate arguments by commas
# 2. Make sure you have a closing parenthesis
# 3. Check your spelling!
# 4. Store the result in pack_sum (for 'package summary')
#
# You should also take a look at ?n and ?n_distinct, so

# select().

# 2. country
# 3. package
# 4. size
#
# The call to print() at the end of the chain is optional,
# but necessary if you want your results printed to the
# console. Note that since there are no additional arguments
# to print(), you can leave off the parentheses after
# the function name. This is a convenient feature of the %>%
# operator.
